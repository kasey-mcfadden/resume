## [Resume](./static/pdf/resume.pdf)

I'm a software developer and current undergraduate student at Princeton University pursuing an engineering bachelor's degree in computer science. I'm thinking about concentrating in Machine Learning & Statistics or Cognitive Science.

On campus, I'm a [Learning Consultant](https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/about/meet-our-staff/learning-consultants) with the McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning, meaning I consult students to help them form an individualized and strategic approach to learning. I'm also a varsity student-athlete on the Division I Men's Heavyweight [Rowing Team](https://goprincetontigers.com/sports/mens-rowing). In the past I've been a key member of the [HackPrinceton](https://www.hackprinceton.com/) organizing team, contacting companies directly to secure funding for one of the world's most prestigious hackathons, sharing responsibility for budgets greater than 70,000$/semester.

My industry experience includes: Cloud Computing, Serverless Infrastructure, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Go, C++, Java, Python, Javascript, Shell Scripting, MATLAB, SQL, Influx, API Gateway, Lambda, Web APIs, Grafana, and more.

If you're interested in working with someone who is quick to adapt to emerging technologies and passionate about computer science, or would like to collaborate, shoot me an email.

In my free time, I enjoy cycling local routes, hiking in the Tri-state area, and surfing or swimming at the NJ shore.
